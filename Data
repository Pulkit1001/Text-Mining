i love cars
Mclaren needs to improve its engine
great selection of automobile
you can t just explain it that s why u gotta show them
ferrari is the most expensive
too slow to start
even though the engine isn t always perfect the selection of cars is irresistible
the cars have issues and tyres are too slippery
it is very good quality
love the sound of it
